<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Social Media API project aims to develop a robust and scalable backend system that provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to power a social media platform. This API will be built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User Management: Register, log in, and manage user profiles with authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Post Management: CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts with various retrieval options.</li>
  <li>Security and Privacy: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user data protection and privacy.</li>
  <li>Performance and Scalability: Optimize API performance and scalability using caching, pagination, and asynchronous processing.</li>
  <li>Documentation and Testing: Create comprehensive API documentation and implement unit/integration tests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with the Social Media API, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/dhruvadeepSocialMedia-API.git</code></li>
  <li>Install the dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
  <li>Set up the database: Add postgres URL on <code>app > database.py file</code></li>
  <li>Configure the API: <code>source /bin/Scripts/activate</code></li>
  <li>Run the API: <code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload</code></li>
  <li>Access the API documentation: Open your browser and visit <code>http://localhost:8000/docs</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Although this project has so many users in future, it is very hard to scake without any proper cloud provider or team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Security: When the application grows in size it will cause problems with security</li>
  <li>Scalability: This type of projects arent much scalable</li>
  <li>Cost of Running: It will take money to run databases and servers</li>
  <li>Limited Functionality: Its a basic app, hence doesnt provide many functionalities that are provided by other media apps</li>
</ol>
